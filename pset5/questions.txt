0.  BMP: 24-bit color.
    GIF: 8-bit color.
    JPEG: 24-bit color.
    PNG: 48-bit color.
    
1.  GIF and PNG supports animation.

2.  The lossless compression recreates a compressed an identical match to its original form, and 
    the lossy compression can't be used to compress anything that needs to be reproduced exactly.
    
3.  JPEG is lossy compression.

4.  The system modifies the filenames's first character in the file's directory. Then the system moves all the file's
    FAT clusters to the hard drive's list of free clusters.

5.  I purchase a sanitization tool.
    
6.  Declares sets of integer types having specified widths.

7.  Because it's a specific way to say how much bits wide you will use.

8.  BYTE is 1 byte.
    DWORD is a 4 bytes.
    LONG is 4 bytes.
    word is 2 bytes.

9.  The first two bytes of the BMP file format are the characters "B" then the character "M" (0x4d42)

10. bfSize returns the size of a bitmap file. bisize specifies the lenght of the structure.

11. If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB with the origin at the upper left corner.

12. The biBitCount specifies the BMP's color depth.

13. If fopen return NULL is because it could't create the outfile.

14. Always is 1 because it's reading one number of elements at a time.

15. If the value of bi.biWidth is 3 the value of padding must be 3,
    because (3 pixels) x (3 bytes per pixel) = 9 bytes which is not a multiple of 4. 
    So (9 bytes) + (3 bytes of padding) = 12 bytes, which is a multiple of 4.

16. fseek sets the file position of the inptr to the given padding.

17. Is the current position of the file pointer.

18. It was Milo Banana.
