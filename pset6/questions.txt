1.  It return resource usage statistics for the calling process.

2.  There are 16 members.

3.  Because by reference it takes less resources.

4.  The main function read character per character until it hit a newline or a space. The words with a length greater than
    45 and numbers we add them to the dictionary but we don't check it for misspelings.

5.  I think you use fgetc instead fscanf because with fscanf you read an entire word and you can't know if the word have a
    number or a non-character in it, so you can't skip that word for check the spelling.

6.  Because this parameters never gonna change.

7.  I used hashtable and linked lists. The hashtable has a size of 500, in each node its a word and a pointer to another
    word or null if is the end of the linked list.

8.  Fast.

9.  I don't do it any changes.

10. I don't think so.
